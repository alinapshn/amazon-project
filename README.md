# Amazon Project

This project is a simplified Amazon clone, developed while following the [JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&list=PPSV) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev).  
All scripts and functionality were written step by step during the course.
